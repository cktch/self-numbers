# Show and Sum of all self-numbers using php

#### More info about self-numbers is here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self_number

#### Case:

In 1949 the Indian mathematician D.R. Kaprekar discovered a class of numbers called self-numbers.

For any positive integer n, define d(n) to be n plus the sum of the digits of n.

For example, d(75) = 75 + 7 + 5 = 87.

The number n is called a generator of d(n).

Some numbers have more than one generator: for example, 101 has two generators, 91 and 100.

A number with no generators is a self-number.

There are thirteen self-numbers less than 100: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 20, 31, 42, 53, 64, 75, 86, and 97.

#### Question:
- Write a program to sum of all self-numbers which are bigger than 0 and smaller than 5000.

#### Answer:
So with this code, I will show which are the "self-numbers" and SUM of them (bigger than 0 and smaller than 5000)
 - The sum is: 1,227,365
 - There are 494 self-numbers
